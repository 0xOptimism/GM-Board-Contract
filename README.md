# Hardhat Project for the GM Board

This contract is the solidity backend of the GM board, it is still in progress on regulary tested on Rinkeby network.

The goal of this project is to learn more about solidity and pooling some ETH to pick a random winner.
Keep in mind that i'm not using an oracle such as chainlink so the contract can still get easily exploited so i don't recommend to use it on Mainnet.

Feel free to contributes to the repo if you want to learn with me.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
